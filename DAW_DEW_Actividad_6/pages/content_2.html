    jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes
    things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling,
    animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a
    multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility,
    jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
